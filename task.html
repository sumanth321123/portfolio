      <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves both
        front-end development, where the user interacts with the interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end
        development, which manages server-side logic and databases using languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js.
        Full-stack developers are proficient in both aspects. Frameworks such as React and Angular simplify front-end
        development, while back-end frameworks like Express.js and Django streamline server-side processes. The code is
        managed using version control systems like Git, facilitating collaboration among developers. Responsive web
        design ensures that sites work well on various devices. Security measures, including encryption and
        authentication, are crucial to protect against vulnerabilities. Hosting services like AWS and Heroku provide
        platforms for deployment, and content management systems like WordPress aid in site management. APIs enable
        integration with external services, contributing to the dynamic and collaborative nature of web development.
        Developers use tools like IDEs and browser developer tools to code, debug, and optimize websites and
        applications for functionality and user experience.</p> <a href="#13">Back to top</a>

          <h5 id="1">WWW</h5>
          <img src="download (1).jpg" alt="WWW image">
          <p>The World Wide Web, commonly known as the WWW or simply the web, is a vast information space accessible
            over the internet. It consists of interconnected documents and resources, linked together by hyperlinks and
            URLs. Tim Berners-Lee introduced the concept of the WWW in 1989, revolutionizing the way people access and
            share information.</p> <a href="#13">Back to top</a>

          <h5 id="2">HTTP</h5>
          <img src="download (2).jpg" alt="HTTP image">
          <p> HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web. It is an application protocol for distributed,
            collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. HTTP facilitates the transfer of various types of data,
            such as text, images, and multimedia, between web servers and clients. This protocol forms the basis for web
            communication, allowing browsers to retrieve and display web content.</p> <a href="#13">Back to top</a>

          <h5 id="3">URL</h5>
          <img src="download.png" alt="URL image">
          <p>
            A URL is a standardized address used to access resources on the internet. It serves as a reference or link
            to a specific web resource, specifying the protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name or IP address,
            and the path to the resource. URLs play a crucial role in navigating the web and locating specific content.

      <h4 id="11">HTML</h4>
      <img src="download (4).jpg" alt="HTML image">
      <p>HTML serves as the backbone of web development, providing the structure and semantics for creating documents on
        the World Wide Web. It utilizes a markup language consisting of tags to define elements such as headings,
        paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render the content that
        users see. As a foundational language, HTML lays the groundwork for building web pages and ensures proper
        organization and accessibility of information.</p> <a href="#13">Back to top</a>

        <li>
          <h5 id="4">Text</h5><img src="download (1).png" alt="Text image">
          <p> Text is a fundamental component of web content. Whether it's articles, blog posts, or user-generated
            comments, text conveys information and communicates ideas. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the primary
            language for structuring and presenting textual content on the web, providing a standardized way to format
            and display information.</p>

        <li>
          <h5 id="5">Images</h5><img src="download (5).jpg" alt="image">
          <p>Images enhance the visual appeal and convey information on the web. They can range from photographs and
            illustrations to icons and logos. Web developers use image formats like JPEG, PNG, and GIF to optimize
            visuals for fast loading times. Images are often embedded in HTML documents using the <img> tag.</p>

        <li>
          <h5 id="6">List</h5><img src="download (2).png" alt="List image">
          <p> Lists are a convenient way to organize and structure information on a webpage. HTML supports two main
            types of lists: ordered lists and unordered lists. Ordered lists represent items in a sequential order,
            typically numbered, while unordered lists use bullets or other symbols to denote items.</p>

      <h4 id="12">CSS</h4><img src="download (6).jpg" alt="CSS image">
      <p>CSS complements HTML by enabling the presentation and styling of web content. It allows developers to control
        the visual aspects of HTML elements, including layout, color, font, and spacing. CSS operates on a cascading
        principle, meaning styles can be applied at different levels and cascade down to affect nested elements. By
        separating the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), developers achieve cleaner, more maintainable code
        and can create visually appealing and responsive web designs. CSS3, the latest version, introduces advanced
        features like animations and transitions, enhancing the creative possibilities for web styling. Together, HTML
        and CSS form a powerful duo that underpins the visual and structural aspects of modern web development.</p>

        <li>
          <h5 id="7">Levels</h5><img src="download (7).jpg" alt="levels image">
          <p> HTML headings provide a hierarchical structure to text content. They range from the most significant
            heading to the least significant. Headings help organize content and improve readability, with typically
            representing the main title or section heading.</p>

        <li>
          <h5 id="8">Properties</h5><img src="download (3).png" alt="properties image">
          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) define the presentation and layout of HTML documents. CSS properties control
            various aspects of an element's appearance, such as color, font size, margin, and positioning. Styles can be
            applied directly within HTML tags or externally in a separate CSS file, promoting a consistent design across
            multiple pages.</p>
        </li><a href="#13">Back to top</a>
        <li>
          <h5 id="9">Values</h5><img src="download (8).jpg" alt="values image">
          <p> CSS properties are assigned values that determine how a particular style should be applied. Values can be
            keywords (e.g., bold), numerical measurements (e.g., 10px), percentages, or a combination of these.
            Understanding and manipulating values in CSS allow developers to achieve precise control over the visual
            presentation of web content.
